## Jekyll stuff we didn't talk about:
  * Filters
  * Includes
  * Data files, can be YAML, JSON, or CSV
  * Layout inheritance
  * Custom Collections
  * Pagination

## Other Github Pages features:
  * Can use your own domain
  * Can use github actions to run a generator and commit the results to another branch
    * Means you can use unsupported generators
    * Lets you use a bundler (e.g webpack) and avoid committing libraries to git :)

## Limitations of Github Pages and Jekyll

* No dynamic sites
* Jekyll can be restrictive and requires ruby
* Have to either use CDNs or commit libraries
