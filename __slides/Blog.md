Jekyll has built-in support for blogs

just add some files to the `_posts` magic directory

blog posts must have filenames of the form `[Y-m-d]-[name].[extension]`, e.g `2020-10-14-first.md`

If the date on your post is in the future, jekyll won't process it.

There's quite a bit of code changed this so just [look at the commit](https://github.com/JackRobbers/JackRobbers.github.io/tree/a66b8f89dbe291e6951a491b1a69d74e03bb80b2)
