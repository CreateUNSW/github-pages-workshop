## What is Github Pages?

* Free Static Site hosting service from Github

* Can have sub-domains for different repositories under the same user or organisation
* Flexible, can serve from root, a folder, or a branch

### Your Github Account comes with a free domain to host your own website and website projects!

* Your github website & domain will be **youraccountid.github.io**.
* For example, the slides you are looking now are hosted under **createunsw.github.io**
