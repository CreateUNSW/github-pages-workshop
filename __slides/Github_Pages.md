## What is Github Pages?

* Free Static Site hosting service from Github
* Can either serve raw sites or use the Jekyll static site generator
* Can be served from both public and private repositories 
* Can have sub-domains for different repositories under the same user or organisation
* Flexible, can serve from root, a folder, or a branch
* Has some built-in themes and templates (we won't be using them today though)

### Your Github Account comes with a free domain to build your own website

* Your github website will be **youraccountid.github.io**.
* For example, the slides you are looking now are hosted under **createunsw.github.io**
* You may also build project sites, the url will become **youraccountid.github.io/yourprojectsite/**
