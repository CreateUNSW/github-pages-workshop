## HTML seems pretty tedious right?

Markdown compiles to HTML (or rather a subset of it) and is *almost* like normal text.

These slides are written in Markdown, with a layout applied over them.

TAB

``` markdown
# A heading
## A smaller heading

normal paragraph text

1. A numbered list
100. I don't even have to put the numbers in properly
20. Woooooo
```

compiles to:

# A heading
## A smaller heading

normal paragraph text

1. A numbered list
100. I don't even have to put the numbers in properly
20. Woooooo
