## HTML is the Structure and Content of your Site

* *Most* opening tags need a corresponding end tag and can wrap other tags
  * Opening looks like `<p>`
  * Closing looks like `</p>`
  * Exceptions "empty tags": `<img>`, `<hr>`, and `<input>`. It doesn't make sense for these tags to contain other content (full list [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Empty_element))
* A well structure page is easier to maintain
* Semantic HTML has benefits for users, devs, and for accessibility
  * stuff like `<section>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<div>` etc
  * doesn't affect how things look on the page, so why not add it?

TAB

For Example:

``` HTML
<h1>Hello</h1> <!-- Header text -->
<div>
    <p>Learning how to do HTML</p>
<div>
```
