I would like to acknowledge the Bedegal and Gadigal people who are the Traditional Custodians of the Land on which this workshop is taking place. I want to pay my respect to their Elders past, present and future, and extend the respect to other aboriginal and torres strait islanders who may be attending the workshop or reviewing the workshop slides afterwards. Sovereignty never ceded.
