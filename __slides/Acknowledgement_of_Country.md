CREATE UNSW would like to acknowledge the Bedegal people who are the Traditional Custodians of the Land on which this workshop is taking place. We want to pay our respect to their Elders past, present and future, and extend the respect to any Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders who may be attending the workshop or reviewing the workshop slides afterwards. This is stolen land and sovereignty was never ceded.
